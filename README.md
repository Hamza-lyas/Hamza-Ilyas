  <h1 align="center">Concise IntroductionðŸ‘‹</h1>
Hey Github community! My name is Hamza Ilyas and I am a computer science student at NUML. I am a highly motivated and curious individual with a strong desire to innovate. I excel in collaborative environments, actively contributing my ideas while eagerly learning from others.

My foundation in C++ programming and analytical thinking has equipped me with strong problem-solving abilities. I am currently expanding my skillset by learning **Java** a valuable language for object-oriented programming and developing robust software solutions. Learning the fundamentals and syntax of Java has provided me with insights into its extensive capabilities in multifaceted roles in the programming world. 
<div align="center">
 I hope to expand my Java skillset with experiential projects.
